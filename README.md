# Machine-learning---Unsupervised-Analysis-of-a-dataset-made-of-leaves-


This work has been made for the Machine learning course. The objective of this work is the realization of a Python program allowing providing data visualizations and clustering. 

The data visualizations were done using the implementation of t-SNE, a dimensionality reduction algorithm. In order to select the best value for the "perplexity" metaparameter, different visualizations for different perplexity values were made. The K-mean clustering algorithm was implemented to make the clustering and the ideal number of clusters was deduced by adjusting two metaparameters (number of clusters and niter).
